Hi there! I'm **Sulaiman Sudirman**, a well-rounded [software engineer](https://1x.engineer/) currently based in **Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia**.

I've been focusing on PHP/Laravel development for the past 6 years, after working in full-stack development since the start of my career. I also love dabbling with other technologies, so you'll find me working with different tech stacks from time to time.

I graduated from **National University of Malaysia** in 2011 and worked in Malaysia for 6 years before moving to Singapore in 2017. After 2 years with a Yishun-based company, I relocated to New Zealand in 2019, where I spent 2 years in Auckland and obtained permanent residency.

In 2021, I landed a remote position with a US-based company, which allowed me to travel extensively around the globe for 4 years—until I was laid off in December 2025. I'm now back in Malaysia, putting down roots.

**Beyond tech**, I love hiking and connecting with nature, playing badminton, reading manga, and watching sci-fi and horror movies.
