Hi there, I am **Sulaiman Sudirman**, also called *Leman*, or *Solomon* by my non-Malaysian friends. I am a well-rounded [software engineer](https://1x.engineer/), who is currently based in **Auckland, New Zealand**.

Weirdly I am not into software development until my second year of study (Bachelor of IT, Science and System Management) at **National University of Malaysia** (2008â€”2011). It has become my passion ever since then, and I was that nerd guy in a class who people will look for help about coding assignment.

I am mostly doing backend development using **PHP** language, though I am also interested to learn other backend technologies, like **NodeJS** and **Go**. 

I also have some decent skills in other field of development that made me a full fledged full stack developer, such as frontend, database, infrastructure, mobile, and even client relationship development.

Outside of work, sometimes you would find me in tech meetups, to mingle with fellow nerds, or hackathons, just to get my million dollar ideas out of my head.

Other than tech, I love to do hiking and become one with mother nature. I also love to play badminton so I can pretend to be a ninja with my quick reflex. 

I also love reading Japanese comics and animations, usually Shounen genre. And watching sci-fi and horror movies.

My motto in life: Dare to try, dare to fail.
